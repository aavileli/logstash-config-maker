# Logstash Config Maker

This project is aimed at people looking to get started with [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash). It provides a web-based UI to create Logstash config files. Created config files can be downloaded and used with Logstash.

In the future, the UI will also allow users to test their config files online.
